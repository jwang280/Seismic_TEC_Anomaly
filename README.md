# Ionospheric TEC anomaly as an earthquake precursor
This project is to discover the relationship between Ionospheric Total Free-Electron Contentï¼ˆTEC) anomaly and earthquakes.

The amount of TEC values varies with the amount of radiation received from the Sun.
Thus, TEC values have seasonal variations, TEC values drops since there is less radiation received in winter, and increases in summer.
It also has a strong daily fluctuation, TEC values are high during daytime and near-zero at night-time.
Free-electrons imposes a dipersive delay on the GPS satellite ranging signals broadcasting.
The affection on the ranging signals also varies with TEC values.
