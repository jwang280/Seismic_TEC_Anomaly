# Ionospheric TEC anomaly as an earthquake precursor
This project is to discover the relationship between Ionospheric Total Free-Electron Contentï¼ˆTEC) anomaly and earthquakes in New Zealand.

The amount of TEC values varies with the amount of radiation received from the Sun.Thus, TEC values have seasonal variations, TEC values drop since there is less radiation received in winter, and increases in summer.It also has a strong daily fluctuation, TEC values are high during daytime and near-zero at night-time.Free-electrons imposes a dispersive delay on the GPS satellite ranging signals broadcasting.The affection on the ranging signals also varies with TEC values.

In addition, during earthquake preparations, free-electrons are released from the ground and change the local ionospheric TEC values in a relatively short period of time.When is the TEC anomaly occurs due to earthquake preparations remain controversial? Between 3 days and 2 weeks before and after the earthquakes are discussed in different research articles.

This project will start from collect the original GPS raw data.There are two types of data, one is the GPS observation data from local GeoNet, powered by GNS Science, the other is the navigation data, which is the ephemeris data for GPS constellation, from Scripps Orbit and Permanent Array Center in California.Both types of raw data are in receiver independent exchange format, which enables users to post-process the GPS stations received data and generates more accurate results.
