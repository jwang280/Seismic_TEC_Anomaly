# Ionospheric TEC anomaly as an earthquake precursor
Discover the relationship between Ionospheric Total Free-Electron Contentï¼ˆTEC) anomaly and earthquake.
The amount of TEC values varies with the amount of radiation received from the Sun.
Thus, TEC values have seasonal variations, TEC values drops since there is less radiation received in winter, and vice versa in summer.
It also has a strong daily fluctuation, TEC values are high during daytime and near-zero at night-time.
